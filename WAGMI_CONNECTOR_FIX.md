# Wagmi Connector Fix - Campaign Button Issue

## ðŸš¨ Problem Identified
The error `r.connector.getChainId is not a function` was causing the approval process to fail during campaign creation.

## ðŸ”§ Root Cause
- **Version Compatibility**: Wagmi v2.16.0 has breaking changes in connector API
- **Connector Interface**: The Farcaster MiniApp Wagmi Connector v1.0.0 was trying to call methods that don't exist in the current connector interface
- **Error Propagation**: Connector errors were not being handled gracefully

## âœ… Fixes Applied

### 1. Enhanced Wagmi Configuration (`src/lib/wagmi-config.ts`)
- Added error handling wrapper for connector initialization
- Implemented fallback mechanism (injected wallet if Farcaster connector fails)
- Added proper logging for connector status
- Enhanced WalletConnect configuration with metadata

### 2. Improved CHESS Token Hook (`src/hooks/useChessToken.ts`)
- Added retry logic that skips connector-related errors
- Enhanced error handling for `getChainId` and connector issues
- Improved logging and debugging information
- Better error messages for users

### 3. Fixed Payment Form (`src/components/PaymentForm.tsx`)
- Added async error handling for approval buttons
- Implemented wallet connection checks before approval
- Added delay mechanism to ensure connector readiness
- Enhanced user feedback for connector issues
- Disabled buttons when wallet is not connected

### 4. Environment Configuration (`.env.example`)
- Added proper environment variable examples
- Included WalletConnect project ID configuration
- Added Farcaster-specific configuration options

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Improvements

### Error Handling
```typescript
// Before: Direct connector call without error handling
approveFarcasterPromo(amount)

// After: Comprehensive error handling
try {
  if (!address || !isConnected) {
    setError("Wallet not connected")
    return
  }
  await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 200))
  approveFarcasterPromo(amount)
} catch (error) {
  if (error.message.includes('getChainId')) {
    setError("Connector issue - please reconnect wallet")
  }
}
```

### Connector Initialization
```typescript
// Before: Direct connector initialization
connectors: [miniAppConnector(), injected(), walletConnect()]

// After: Error-safe connector initialization
connectors: createConnectors() // With try-catch for each connector
```

### Retry Logic
```typescript
// Added smart retry logic that skips connector errors
retry: (failureCount, error) => {
  if (error?.message?.includes('getChainId') || 
      error?.message?.includes('connector')) {
    return false // Skip retry for connector errors
  }
  return failureCount < 3
}
```

## ðŸ§ª Testing Steps

1. **Test Wallet Connection**
   - Connect wallet using different methods (Farcaster, MetaMask, WalletConnect)
   - Verify connector status in debug panel

2. **Test Approval Process**
   - Click "CHESS jÃ³vÃ¡hagyÃ¡sa" button
   - Verify no `getChainId` errors appear
   - Check approval transaction is initiated

3. **Test Error Recovery**
   - Disconnect and reconnect wallet
   - Verify error messages are user-friendly
   - Test fallback connectors work

4. **Test Campaign Creation**
   - Create new campaign with proper approval
   - Verify blockchain transaction completes
   - Check database storage works

## ðŸš€ Expected Results

After applying these fixes:
- âœ… No more `r.connector.getChainId is not a function` errors
- âœ… Approval process works smoothly
- âœ… Better error messages for users
- âœ… Fallback wallet options available
- âœ… Campaign creation completes successfully

## ðŸ“‹ Next Steps

1. **Test the fixes** in development environment
2. **Update dependencies** if newer versions are available:
   ```bash
   npm update @farcaster/miniapp-wagmi-connector
   ```
3. **Monitor for any remaining issues** and iterate as needed
4. **Implement enhanced campaign button features** from the architecture analysis
